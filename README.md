# locoEYE: Real-Time Rail Detection
## Introduction
**locoEYE** is a computer vision project that implements and trains a deep neural network for **real-time railway track detection**. This project adapts the [lanenet-lane-detection-pytorch](https://github.com/IrohXu/lanenet-lane-detection-pytorch.git), originally designed for lane detection in autonomous vehicles to autonomous train navigation tasks.

The project also utilizes the [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com) pipeline to build and train computer vision models
